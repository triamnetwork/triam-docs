Triam Network V3 will strongly support smart contract. Developers can use many program languages to write some awesome smart contracts.

### Getting Started

If you are new, you may want to start with the early [Tutorials](docs/guides/get-started/create-account) to familiarize yourself with some of the building blocks of Triam. You should also investigate the [Javascript SDK](docs/overview?id=overview), and familiarize yourself with the canonical [List of Operations](docs/guides/concepts/list-of-operations), which documents everything you can do with Triam — along with parameters and error codes — and links to the relevant documentation for key SDKs. Finally, you may want to explore the [API Reference](docs/endpoints/accounts-single) documentation, which details every resource, aggregation, and error provided by Horizon, the Triam API.


Once you have a high-level understanding of TriamNetwork v1, you can start building right away, and the subsequent sections of these docs will focus on how to do that. 

Let's review the below documentation to get started with Triam Smart Contract: 

- [List of new operations](docs/contract/operations/Overview.md)
- [Start with a simple example of smart contracts](docs/contract/simpleContract/index?id=simple-contract-with-triam-sdk)
