Testnet
---

The testnet is a small test Triam network, open to developers.

Triam.org runs 3 triam-core validators on this test network. Set your triam-core to connect to us by using this [configuration](https://github.com/triamnetwork/triam-core/blob/master/docs/triam-core_testnet.cfg). You can also find a [Horizon instance](https://horizon-testnet.Triam.org/) that is connected to the testnet.

The testnet is for, well, testing. It's occasionally reset, so don't get attached to any balances or accounts that you have on it.
