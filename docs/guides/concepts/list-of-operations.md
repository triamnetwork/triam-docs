## Create Passive Offer
[JavaScript](http://triamnetwork.github.io/triam-sdk/Operation.html#.createPassiveOffer) 

A passive offer is an offer that does not act on and take a reverse offer of equal price. Instead, they only take offers
of lesser price. For example, if an offer exists to buy 5 BTC for 30 RIA, and you make a passive offer to buy 30 RIA for 5 BTC,
your passive offer *does not* take the first offer.

Note that regular offers made later than your passive offer can act on and take your passive offer, even if the regular
offer is of the same price as your passive offer.

Passive offers allow market makers to have zero spread. If you want to trade EUR for USD at 1:1 price and USD for EUR also
 at 1:1, you can create two passive offers so the two offers don't immediately act on each other.

Once the passive offer is created, you can manage it like any other offer using the [manage offer](#manage-offer) operation.

Threshold: Medium

Result: `CreatePassiveOfferResult`

|Parameters| Type| Description|
